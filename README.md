# subman
A python script for launching video and subs from specified folder and keeping record of watched videos.  

Usage:  
Videos and subtitles must be in separated folder and each one should contains only videos or subtitles with the same format name (and 2 digit for the episode);  
For example:  
```
Videos/  
  Episode01  
  Episode02  
Subtitles/  
  Sub01  
  Sub02  
```	  
Will work.  

  
	  
Viceversa:  
```
Videos/  
  Episode01  
  Episode03  
Subtitles/  
  Sub01  
  Sub02  
  ```
```
Videos/  
  Episode01  
  Episode02  
Subtitles/  
  Sub01  
  Sub02  
  Folder1/  
 ``` 
```
Videos/  
  Episode00  
  Episode02  
Subtitles/  
  Sub01  
  Sub02  
```
```
Videos/  
  Episode1  
  Episode2  
Subtitles/  
  Sub1  
  Sub2  
```    
```
Season1/  
  Episode01  
  Episode02  
  Sub01  
  Sub02  
 ``` 
Will not work.  

This is just a beta, so don't blame me if it sucks: I agree with you.
